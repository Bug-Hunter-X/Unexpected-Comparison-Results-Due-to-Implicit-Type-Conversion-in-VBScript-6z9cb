This example demonstrates a common error in VBScript related to implicit type conversion during comparisons.  The script compares two variables, `a` and `b`, but the comparison's result may be unexpected if the variables hold different data types (e.g., numbers and strings).  The solution shows how to handle such cases using explicit type conversion to ensure accurate comparison results.
